# Women in Tech Career Day: Software Development Track

This repo will get a batch of 3 problems per every 30 minutes.

Points will be assigned per problem. You will find them in their respective `batch` directories.

## Instructions

Each team has a corresponding branch for their submissions. They must then push their submissions on their branch, in the same `batch` directory as the problems they are solving.

- Submissions may be written in any language.
- After submitting, a representative of the group must approach one of our track facilitators to run the tests on their code.
