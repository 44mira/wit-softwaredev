# BATCH 4

## 1. Run-length Encoding (15pts)

Given a string which contains consecutive repeated characters, compress the string by replacing consecutive repeating characters with their count and their character.

Examples:

```
aaaabbc => 4a2b1c
AAaaaa => 2A2a
```

## 2. To camelCase (15pts)

Write a function that converts dashed/underscored strings into their camelCase counterparts.

Examples:

```
very_big_number => veryBigNumber
kebab-var => kebabVar
mixed_casing-variable => mixedCasingVariable
```

## 3. Two Sum (20pts)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Examples: 

```
[2,7,11,15], 9 => [0,1]
[3,2,4], 6 => [1,2]
[3,3], 6 => [0,1]
```
